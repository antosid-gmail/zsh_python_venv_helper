# zsh_python_venv_helper
Having multiple python project each with it's own virtual environtment makes switching between them tedious and hard to track.
```
source venv/bin/activate  
... do something ...
deactivate
```
This simple snippet which is added to my local *.zshrc* file has solved the issue.
